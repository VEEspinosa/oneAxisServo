Contents are the design development of a single axis servo apparatus. Linear motion mechanics include guide rod supports with linear ball bearings, ACME lead screw with fixed-supported roller bearings, a linear encoder strip for positional accuracy of +/- .0005in, and a DRO. The device intent is to determine motor characteristics through a series of diagnostic tests.
